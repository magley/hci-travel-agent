    <h1>Arrangement Search and Filtering</h1>

    <p>
        To aid you in searching amongst hunderds of arrangements, YouTravel provides a
        flexible mechanism for filtering out arrangements to your liking.

    <p>
        Image 1. shows all the controls for searching and filtering.
        <br/>
        Enter any text in the texbox, hit the search button, and we will return arrangements
        with a matching name.
        <br/>
        YouTravel also supports fine-grained filtering:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Active</b> toggles arrangements whose trips are currently in progress.</li>
            <li><b>Upcoming</b> toggles arrangements that are yet to begin.</li>
            <li><b>Finished</b> toggles arrangements that are completed.</li>
        </ul>

        That way, if you want to view or modify arrangements which clients can still book,
        YouTravel offers you to do so.
