    <h1>Arrangement</h1>

    <p>
        An <b>arrangement</b> is an offering for a trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        When our clients browse the YouTravel catalogue, what they will see are all the active travel arrangements.
        The client can book any arrangement, making a reservation for traveling.
        <br />
        Think of an arrangement as a <i>class</i> and reservations as <i>instances</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An arrangement has general information - like the name, description and price - but also a collection of <a href="place.html">places</a>.
        Each place in an arrangement describes a single activity available to all clients booking said arrangement.
