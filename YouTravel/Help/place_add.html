    <h1>Adding and editing places</h1>

    <p>
        When creating, you may specify the following data:
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Description</li>
            <li>Coordinates</li>
            <li>Type</li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
            <img src="img_place_add.png" max-width="100%" />
            <figcaption>Image 1. Place adding/editing screen.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The <b>name</b> should be short and should match the name of the real-life
            location make it easy for the clients to decide if the arrangement suits their
            needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>description</b> is longer and gives more context to the client as to
            what this place entails.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can enter the <b>coordinates</b> manually through their latitude and longitude,
            or by double-cliking the map. Be as accurate as possible, but worry too much if
            you miss by a couple of degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the <b>type</b> determines which type of activity this place represents.
            YouTravel does not care about these types - they are mainly there to aid in searching
            and giving the users a visual aid.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're done, click <b>Save</b> and your changes will automatically be updated.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
            Editing an existing place follows the exact same procedure, and you're free to edit
            a place at any time.
